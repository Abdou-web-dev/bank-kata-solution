# Bank Kata Solution

This repository contains my solution to the **Bank Kata** challenge.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript (or any other language you're using)
- **Testing Framework**: Jest (or any framework you're using for testing)

## Features Implemented
1. **Account Creation**  
   Users can create a bank account with an initial balance of 0 or a specified amount.

2. **Deposit**  
   A deposit can be made into the bank account, updating the balance accordingly.

3. **Withdrawal**  
   Money can be withdrawn from the account, and the balance is updated.

4. **Bank Statement**  
   The bank statement prints a transaction history, including deposits and withdrawals.

## Known Issues
- **Test Failures**:  
  There might be some tests failing, but the core functionality (deposit, withdrawal, and statement printing) works as expected.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdou-web-dev/bank-kata-solution.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd <bank-kata-folder>
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
    mvn test
   ```

## Usage
- The solution includes the basic functions for the bank account (deposit, withdraw, and print statements).
- You can use the class and methods provided in the code to simulate a bank account.
